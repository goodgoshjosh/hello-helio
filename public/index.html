  <h1>Josh and his cats</h1>
  <p>This is a page about my two cats.</p>

  <h2>The Kitties</h2>
  <p>The name of my cats are Mr. Waffles and Kalliope. Mr. Waffles is orange and four and a half years old, and Kalliope is grey and a year and a half.</p> 
  <p>I adopted Mr. Waffles from Best Friends and Kalliope from CAWS. The links to those organizations are at the top of the page.</p>
  <p>Here is a picture of Mr. Waffles and Kalliope</p>

  <h1>Personalities</h1>
 
  <h2 style="color:orange">Mr. Waffles</h2>
  <p>Mr. Waffles is a little more lazy than Kalliope. He spends most of his day napping, but he's a talented jumper. He often jumps on top of our doors, balancing precariously until he decides to leap off.</p>
  <p> Mr. Waffles is incredibly cuddly at night and loves to climb up on your chest when you're sitting down and he'll get right into your face while purring and kneading on you. At night, he likes to sleep by your side like a teddy bear. It's both endearing and slightly annoying, especially when he non-stops purrs and starts drooling.</p>

  <h2 style="color:silver">Kalliope</h2>
  <p>Kalliope is the princess that runs the house. She is very talktative and expressive. When you come home, it's instant meowing and she'll follow you around and chat at you. It's most likely because she wants treats.</p>
  <p>She likes to be cradled in my arms, with her tummy on them when I hold her. However, when Chris holds her, she likes to be held like a baby. Either way, when you hold her after she's been meowing, it is instant purrs and sounds like an engine.</p>
